1. Yes, we feel removing numbers will help save space as these not not queried. Moreover, by having numbers in different format
its necessary to normalise them which will make it effective in searching if they are ever used.
There are 41% terms which contain number and this can save a lot of space in dictionary and memory

2. In the given data although there aren't many stop words but their frequency is quite high and hence use lot of posting list memory.
If we remove them we will have to handle it in searching as well to avoid imperfect results with no posting lists.

Total of 116547 document frequency of all stop words is present which occupies lot of space in posting list

3. Does a good job overall but it has some issues like:

- words like wheat/1.0, xj-6, shex/4,000 aren't resolved properly and will give inaccurate results.
We can fix by removing these special characters explicitly
- Improper way of splitting and parsing words which is usually cause of bad data so we might need some correctors
and checking against a glossary to see if they are actual words
